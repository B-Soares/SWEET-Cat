SWEET-Cat
=========

Repository for the SWEET-Cat(alog), a table for FGKM stars hosting exoplanets.


TODO
====

   - Make a function that look at the latest update on SWEET-Cat and compare
     with the latest update on exoplanet.eu. If not the same, SWEET-Cat should
     be updated.
   - Many of the SWEET-Cat things can be done automatically, e.g. write all the
     things in the table.
   - Create files automatically for ParralaxSpec.py, TorresMass.py, and
     Simbad.py.
   - Create a NEWNEW1. This one is just a file with the names for creating the
     Simbad script (see e.g. in folder).
   - The toughest challenge must be to find values in articles. I guess we must
     do this part manually, but we might be able to make a script that notifies
     us, if it finds article from Santos or Sousa, so we can set the homogenity
     flag to 1.
